# Its Halloween and all the kids just got home from trick-or-treating. 
# we have a list representing how much candy each child in our group has made out with. 
# We don't want the kids to start arguing, and we know trouble is brewing as many of the children 
# in the group have received different amounts of candy from each home.
# So we want each child to have the same amount of candies, only we can't exactly take any candy away from the kids, 
# that would be even worse. 
# Instead we decide to give each child extra candy until they all have the same amount.

# In the first case the most candies are given to second kid , 8. 
# Because of that we will give the first kid 3 so he can have 8 
# and the third kid 2 
# and the fourth kid 4, so all kids will have 8 candies.
# So we end up handing out 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.

# Examples:
# input: [5,8,6,4]
# output: 9
# input: [1,2,4,6]
# output: 11

# Notes:
# the length of the list of children will always be greater than one.
